# Kubernetes

I'm creating this Kubernetes cheatsheet in order to identify and debug common problems and always have useful commands at hand at any time. 
The project is still in the making so please be sure to double-check before using any of the commands showed in this repository.

Feel free to make requests for updates or correct mistakes.
